# Multiple Choice \(with Radio boxes\)

A multi-purpose field used to allow the user to "choose" one or more options. It can be rendered as radio boxes or as radio buttons.  
On submit, this field will generate the following tokens: \[&lt;FieldName&gt;\] \(which yields the value\), \[&lt;FieldName&gt;:Text\], \[&lt;FieldName&gt;:Value\]. Note that if your options don't have a value \(there's nothing after the pipe character in the item list\), then all the tokens above will return same value.

### Options:

* Display Horizontally

  * this option enables you to display radioboxes next to each other on the same line.

* Link To

  * Link this to another multi-select field that when changed will cause this control to update with different items. For example, imagine Category and Subcategory selection. When this option is used, prefix each item below with the name of the parent category like this: "Value Of Parent Item/This Item". 
  
    > **Note:** When linking to another field and using the Items Data Source, if any part of the text or value of the options in the field includes a forward slash (/) character, that character must also be escaped using a back slash (\\) character. For example, if you are using HTML in your item list you must escape the backslash in closing tags: &lt;b&gt;Item 1&lt;\\/b&gt;

* Datasource

  * Choose from existing data sources([detailed here](datasource/index.html)) or provide values into the Item List area; Input one item per line. If you need to provide different text and value, then separate them by pipe. Can contain [My Tokens](/my-tokens/index.html).
